#ThoughtBox

Thought box is an application designed to let users come back to links and articles they don't have time to read right this second.

You can sign in on the main page and you'll be able to see only your own links, and mark those links as read or unread.

At the moment Thought Box is a straight Rails project with JavaScript/Ajax functionality planned to remove excess page loads.

To try the app locally yourself, clone it down, run `bundle`, and `rails s` in your terminal. Then visit `localhost:3000`
